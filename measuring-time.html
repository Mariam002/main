<h2> IN SEASON: a produce app</h2>

<p> Time can be viewed as cyclical, like the four seasons of the year. For this assignment I wanted to measure time through a seasonal produce app, and more specifically a fun and helpful way of tracking them. In Season is an app that keeps track of all fruits and vegetables in a person's designated region. It is an app for the produce enthusiasts who look forward to when products are at their very best, to hit the shelves at the grocery store. It tracks what's in season during the months and can allow the user to input their own countdown to when their favourite items are at their peak. Through histograms and charts this app makes it easy to access all information regarding any produce.  </p>
