<h1> IN FREE FALL </h1>

<h2> QUESTION: </h2>

<p> Q1:Steyerl points to how aerial imagery and 3D-generated environments have altered the way we conceive of time and space. Because what we see now regularly incorporates views that can only be generated by machines, more specifically computers, she argues that we live in a society of “hyperreal representations—not of space as it is, but of space as we can make it—for better or worse” (26). What kinds of social or cultural consequences do you think Steyerl is alluding to when she says “for better or worse”? Provide an example.
</p>

<h2> RESPONSE: </h2>

<p>
R1: I think what Steyerl might be alluding to when she says “for better or worse” is the idea of technology today being able to do such advanced things, but not always for the right or necessary reasons. On the one hand, these machines being created are cool new ways to experience places and views that one has never seen before, but on the other, it can really mess with reality. Perhaps this world Steyerl talks about is one in which people prefer what they cannot see in person, which is where it can be for the worse. In this world people then gravitate towards the “hyperreal representations” of these spaces and environments that can’t be replicated. A social consequence of technology that produces pixel by pixel renders of views, manipulating reality (VR), is that it can create isolation and confusion.

Virtual reality has advanced so much today, so that people can even own headsets that allow them to enter these new worlds and tune out the rest of society around them. People, especially younger audiences who grow up surrounded by these machines, can easily fall into this blurred area of what is supposed to be real and what is fake. When spending hours upon hours in spaces that aren't real, it can take a while for someone to readjust back. This bubble created then proposes many issues including an isolated reality and social interaction problems with others, not to mention how one interacts with the real outside world.
