<h1> THE INVISIBLE USER & WEBSITES </h1>

<h2> QUESTIONS: </h2>

<p> Q1. What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. 
</p>

<p> Q2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst). </p>

<h2> RESPONSES: </h2>

<p>
R1: 
Lialina defines the universal user to be someone who can find other ways to do things online, on a platform that was not or has not designed a specific task to be done. I think this is an interesting way of looking at a user, and an accurate one for those who surf the internet and can do it all. Universal users can adapt and do not need things to be laid out perfectly for them.  
 </p>

<p> 
In a similar way Schwulst's argument on websites over platforms talks about how much more freedom and creativity this allows for people. She writes, “This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations.” Today we have so many platforms run by corporations calling the shots and there is no involvement happening with the users. But like Lialina mentions, the users are not dumb. A lot of them, including myself, can figure out ways around things. Corporations want to make the computer “invisible” by making it an experience, but having this involvement, although granted a small amount, can make for this better user experience all around. So, rather than making something “perfect” and not leaving extra leeway for universal users, there shouldn't be any questioning of how one chooses to roam the internet. These platforms can often be unfair to users by micromanaging and restricting certain areas. Leading to Schwulst's point of directing more people into creating websites, paving the way of the web into their own hands, with their own intentions; someone who can make a website to fit their wants and needs. Which I find could be a great approach, especially to those in a creative field.  </p>

<p> 
R2: 
I too am a universal user without even realizing it, I am a learner and a curious one at that. “There can be different examples and levels of autonomy that users can imagine for themselves, but the capacity to be universal is still in all of us.” I wholeheartedly agree with this statement made by Lialina, as someone who is constantly opening doors like portals not knowing where it might direct me. I imagine it like the Monsters Inc. doors that take you into individual rooms to explore. It may be bit of a surprise but never disappointing. I use the internet and my laptop as a directory for anything that can be thought of, with endless possibilities. It is an outlet for discovery, entertainment, and everything else in between.  </p>
