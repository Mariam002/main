<h1> CODES, LOGIC, LETTERS, PLAY </h1>

<h2> QUESTION: </h2>

<p> Q1. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature. 
</p>

<h2> RESPONSE: </h2>

<p>
R1: 
Programmatic systems are mostly technical and often mathematical depending on how methodical they are. Patterns in nature that appear to be pragmatic are systematic in approach “…processes are usually focused on controlling the results...to achieve the desired finished product.” (Biľak) An example of this can be through biophysical systems and their processes in living things. These systems use principles and patterns. This is like many cycles we see in our science classes which follow a system of steps in order to produce carbon or nitrogen etc... which all repeat.

Or it can be seen in agriculture, the science and art of cultivation on the soil, raising crops and rearing livestock. It can be seen as a system or pattern with how farmers harvest crops, there is an input, a process and then an output. This annual cycle includes crop selection, land prep, seed selection, seed sowing, irrigation, crop growth, fertilizing and harvesting.

Farmers have this set routine that is very procedural in order to get the proper outcome. This can be viewed in a similar way to how Just van Rossum explains the fundamentals of waveforms, through calculated algorithms, and their frequencies. Imputing letterforms to sounds and viewing the process and how it reacts to certain outcomes.
